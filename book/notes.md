## UTF-8
Throughout the book we are going to mark all character sets as UTF-8. The ability to support all languages ensures you 
will have the ability to bring your application to any locale you'd like. 
If you're not convinced this is useful, I'd highly recommend reading the [UTF-8 Manifesto](https://utf8everywhere.org)
