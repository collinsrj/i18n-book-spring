# Designers
The challenge facing designers is to recognise that the designs will not be pixel perfect. With each user locale there 
will be differences in the interface is rendered. For web and mobile applications this means content will be laid 
out differently. Text lengths will differ. English is quite compact when compared to other languages. It is on the 
designer to cater for this at design time. It is not the job of the engineer to resolve poor layout decisions.
  
## Use a Design System
For designs to be robust and usable in different locales, a design system is essential. A design system will give all 
stakeholders confidence that the system being built is robust and will cater for everyone's needs.
